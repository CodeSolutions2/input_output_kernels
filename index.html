	<h2>Observation 0: Disaster and Data</h2>
	
	<p>Disaster occurs when people, objects, and/or things are transformed in an unproductive manner. The dictionary definition of "destroy" is "to reduce (an object) to useless fragments, a useless form, or remains, as by rending, burning, or dissolving; injure beyond repair or renewal; demolish; ruin; annihilate" [1]. Destruction can take the form of many behaviors, including: physical destruction of life (ie: violence), physical destruction of material property (ie: breaking a PC because you did not win at a video game), destruction of mental health (ie: excessive competition, harassment, self-sabotage). 
	<br><br>
	When one lives a life influenced by disaster and destruction it means that:</p>
	<br>
	<ol>
		<li>one can not control their brain in a self-productive manner, such that they can think logically and calmly without being triggered by strong emotions.</li>
		<li>one acts as if they do not want a future by: creating no short and long-term goals, having no self-improvement, not acquiring objects (ie: money, car, home) and/or titles of value and significance.  Accomplishments, created by daily actions, show that one has a future in our society. It is very difficult to create nothing and/or destroy everything, and suddenly start over again and catch-up to the current level of modern society; it takes decades or more to build stable structures. Destroying one's things or having no ambition to accomplish something creates no future.</li>
		<li>one desire no self-improvement for themselves or others. Figuratively speaking, one desires nothing except "dirt and ash", which is all that is left after significant disaster and destruction events. Another parallel of destruction of property, is "returning to nature or a simplistic way of living" in an advanced technological age. It is not logical or productive for the evolution of human civilization to return to using simplistic methods 100 years ago, after having advanced scientific understanding of our environment and ourselves. When a person graduates from university, do they return to elementary school to learn how to read? One does not, one in fact values and improves upon what they learned before, accumulating all of the knowledge.</li>
		<li>one lives in the past because everyone who does not destroy their things are constantly creating, working together, and advancing to the future; unfortunately leaving behind people who destroy themselves and others around them. Feelings of revenge and competition are often fostered by those who were "left behind", unwillingly causing themselves to repeat an endless cycle of destructive behavior.</li>
		<li>one becomes less connected to reality due to fear and lack of interest in building a productive future and life; they become isolated and have less access to modern technology.</li>
		<li>one creates limited mental beliefs of what they can and can not do because they do not understand the full range of possible choices that are available. In short many people whom experience disaster/destruction in their life lack education about the activities that they are involved in, poor life decisions are often made without up-to-date knowledge about societal related activities and career.</li>
	</ol>
		
	<br>
	<p>Creation and destruction are similar to the Birth and Death cycle in numerical modeling, people who destroy are likely to die-out due to lack and those who create are likely to survive due to growth and improvement. I have observed that many people who have had disaster or tremendous loss in their life, have anger and resentment for their losses, making violence and destruction justified. Therefore, just by being exposed to unfortunate situations, it is human nature to repeat destruction in some form (ie: vandalism, abuse, harassment). People exposed to disaster may influence people to destroy things, simply due to conditioned behavior that everyone deems as normal.</p>
	<br><br>
	<p>Not only is disaster a physical phenomenon, it has lasting physical and psychological effects. Physical and psychological effects include depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), gastro-intestinal disorders [2]. By understanding which features/factors are involved with disaster, perhaps individual change and self-empowerment can be obtained by simple day-to-day behaviors related to reversing disaster exposure behavior.</p>

	<h2>Data Science Prompt</h2>

	<h3>[1] Input daily-life problem</h3>	
	<p>Enter a daily-life problem, to see what type of disaster it is equivalent to. Comparing a daily-life problem to a disaster may help one have a better persepctive on one's life, such that they can make better future life decisions.</p>

	<input id="input_text" type="text" value="" placeholder="Enter daily-life problem" rows="1" cols="100" style='text-align: left; width: 400px;'>

	<h3>[2] Input OpenAI key</h3>
<p>Obtain an OpenAI key at <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a>.  After entering your daily-life problem and OpenAI key, click the Run Selection button.</p>

	<input id="apikey" type="text" value="" placeholder="Enter OpenAI key" rows="1" cols="50" style='text-align: left; width: 400px;'>
	
	<button onclick="observation0_run_selection()" style='text-align: left;'>Run Selection</button>
	

	<h3>[3] Model responses discussing the problem</h3>
	<p>The first response box ranks the users problem from 0 to 100, where 0 is not a severe daily-life problem and 100 is a severe daily-life problem.  The second and thrid response boxes give a metaphorical comparison of your daily-life disaster/problem to a real natural and hand-made disaster.<br></p>

	<textarea id="outData_disaster_ranking" style='display:none; text-align: left;' rows="1" cols="50" placeholder="Model response: ranking"></textarea>
	<br>
	<textarea id="outData_natural_disaster" style='display:none; text-align: left;' rows="4" cols="100" placeholder="Model response: natual disaster"></textarea>
	<br>
	<textarea id="outData_humanmade_disaster" style='display:none; text-align: left;' rows="4" cols="100" placeholder="Model response: human-made disaster"></textarea>

	<p><br>Reflect upon the metaphorical responses with respect to your problems. Perhaps a problem that seemed like a disaster, is not in fact a disaster. And, perhaps, long-term problems that seemed normal might actually be serious problems that need corrective planning in order to repair. Knowing the severity of your problems, can help you to take correct actions and be responsible for your life.</p>

	<h2>Observation 4: Take responsibility for your life</h2>

	<p>Taking responsibility for one's self is to not blaim other people or things for success or non-success.</p>

	<br>
	<p>Taking responsibility for one's self is to choose and inform other's about how you would like to be treated. Thus, understanding one's self, one's limits, and being organized such that one is able to tell other people what one needs and/or does not need for their life to be happy, healthy, and successful.</p>

	<br>
	<p>Taking responsibility for one's self is to know one's limits for risky behavior and responsibility. Taking on too much responsibility by participating in situations where you are held responsible, can give you an unreliable repuation for not completing promises and even prevent you from acheiving your desired short-term and long-term agenda due to inability to physically complete tasked work/situational promises. In my opinion, the practice of gossiping, announcing information about other people, and talking about other people in front of an audience forces the people present to be responsible/connected to the information that was discussed. Similar, to work meetings, everyone included in the room is partially responisble for the information discussed. Thus, in order to be effective, it is good practice to try to avoid being included with situations and information that is not aligned with your short-term and long-term goals, such that you are not obligated to take responsibility for things that you are not interested with and/or have nothing to do with your life.</p>
	
	<br>
	<p>If you can not make, execute, and receive rewards from decisions and/or actions that you have made and/or done, to have long-term success, you are likely included in situations that do not foster/agree with your life well-being and thinking. In such a situation, it is necessary to take "responsibility for your life" by :</p>
		<ol>
			<li>evaluating what you would like to happen to you,</li>
			<li>evaluating how you feel and how you would like to feel about the situation,</li>
			<li>identify situational aspects that prevent you from obtaining "what you would like to happen" and "how you would like to feel",</li>
			<li>identify a few changes/improvements to the situational aspects that would allow you to improve your life,</li>
			<li>tell others in real-life how you would like to be treated with respect to the situational aspects and give your suggestions for improvements and how it would impact/improve your life.</li>
		</ol>
	
	<br>
	<p>You will need to repeat your message of how you would like to be treated, and give constructive feedback to others so that they understand and respect your wishes (ie: human rights) about how you would like to be treated. Do not be discouraged if your life does not immediately improve, be persistent in a calm and logical manner and document small events/improvements as milestones for success and/or improvements to goal planning about the situation.</p>
	
	<br>
	<h3>"Event-based responsive" selection versus "Long-term thoughtful" selection</h3>
	<p>It is common behavior for people to say "no, I do not want that/it/him/her/them" or "I do not need it/that", for situations that are not desireable. But, these phrases only address and give guidance, for one event at one instance. These phrases are less effective phrases to guide one's life with because they give no short-term or long-term guidance for how one would want to be treated in life with respect to varied situations. "Event-based responsive" selection is responding to the situation with the opinion of the group/environment, with an emotional "yes" or "no" without performing constructive feedback steps 3 and 4 to guide the situation to better align with your short-term/long-term goals (ie: how you would like to be treated with respect to the current situation and similar future situations).</p>

	<br>
	<p>Imagine if you went to an LLM promt and typed "I do not want that", the LLM would not have any information to understand what you want. Instructing/guiding your life is the same as writing a good descriptive LLM prompt or a good concise Internet search keyword phrase into the browser. Short-term goals, long-term goals, acceptable daily-life interactions and behavior are ways to make instructions and guidelines for one's life. Making instruction and guidelines for one's life need to be specific and concise such that you and other's can organize actions and ideas in order to accomplish them. "Long-term thoughtful" selection of things, like concepts/ideas, life-styles, and behaviors, that you want in life means to make and enforce guidelines in response to life-feedback that are aligned with your life-goals. For example, if you apply for a job and receive a lot of negative environmental feedback about your profile/presence, it is thoughtful in a long-term manner be persistant and take responsibility for your life, instead of blaiming, complaining, or being demanding. Again, taking "responsibility for your life" means to have short-term and long-term goals, evaluate the situation, identify improvements to the situation that would allow your goals to be full-filled, execute the improvements and receive feedback. Continue taking "responsibility for your life" until you either get-better/evolve and fit-into the situation, aligned with your goals, and/or you find an environment/group that align with your goals. Taking "responsibility for your life" for the example, is to either try to change your profile to match the environmental feedback or try to find jobs that better match your profile/presence in the environment with less effort and profile change. It is not a certainty that you find a job, however with persistance and continued effort improves the chances of success, because everything that you do to accomplish your goals will allow more improved knowledge and information about the goal/s with respect to what you did, to come to you. In addition, having a "Long-term thoughtful" selection approach to life creates a more peaceful, intelligent, and meaningful life than a "Event-based responsive" emotional approach.</p>

	<h2>Data Science Prompt</h2>

	<h3>[1] Input a long-term thoughtful life-selection phrase</h3>	
	<p>Practice creating a long-term thoughtful selection phrase for guiding your life. If the phrase is written clearly and concisely, the LLM will tell you whether it understands your life-guidance phrase or not. If the LLM understands your life-guidance phrase, it will recommend information about your phrase.</p>
